github repository for data, R and SAS scripts made while writing the manuscript 'Epidemiology of Co-Colonized Methicillin Resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus'. Cleaning of study data began in SAS v9.2 and project migrated to R shortly thereafter. 
Several sections of this analysis code did not contribute to the manuscript, 
they are left in the document to demonstrate data exploration and possible methods of analysis.
